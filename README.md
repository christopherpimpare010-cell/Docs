# Ghost Docs

This repository contains the official developer documentation for
[Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost), published at
[docs.ghost.org](https://docs.ghost.org/).

## Local development

Local previews require a Node.js version supported by [`package.json`](./package.json).
Enable pnpm through Corepack and install the repository dependencies:

```sh
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The preview is available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Validation

Run the documentation checks before opening a pull request:

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm a11y
```

These checks currently expose known findings on `main`. Compare your results
with `main` and avoid introducing additional failures.

See the [contribution guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repository
workflow.

## Deployment

The Mintlify GitHub App creates pull request previews. Merging to `main`
triggers deployment to [docs.ghost.org](https://docs.ghost.org/); monitor the
`Mintlify Deployment` check for the result.
