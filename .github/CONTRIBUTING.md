## Working on the documentation

This repository contains the Mintlify source for
[docs.ghost.org](https://docs.ghost.org/). Local previews require a Node.js
version supported by [`package.json`](../package.json). Enable pnpm through
Corepack and install the repository dependencies:

```sh
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The preview is available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm a11y
```

These checks currently expose known findings on `main`. Compare your results
with `main` and avoid introducing additional failures.

Documentation pages use MDX. When adding, moving, or removing a navigable page,
update `docs.json` as part of the same change. Store reusable components in
`snippets/` and site assets in `images/` or `logo/`.

Keep each pull request focused and explain why the change is needed, what it
changes, and how it helps Ghost users or developers. The Mintlify GitHub App
creates a preview for pull requests. After a change is merged to `main`, the app
deploys it to [docs.ghost.org](https://docs.ghost.org/).
